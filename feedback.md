## Final assignment 

### Grade: 

### Comments:

- Documentation:
	- What a neat and simple jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of the tool! 
	- However, I would have hoped for a little more information about the tool in the notebooks so that the user understands what it does without having to study the source script files.. You have some of this info in the main readme which is good, but still the documentation and explanation of the tool is rather minimal. . 
	- Also, it is not evident from the readme or the notebook file that what is the role of the two different script files. 
	- References-section in the README could have included e.g. a ref to the source data.. :) 
	- Good effort with function docstrings (some minor things to improve in formatting..). 
	- Inline comments are informative and purposeful (but should be preceded by an empty line for readability). 
	- Mostly excellent commit messages (visible in the feedback pull request)

- Analysis, visualizations & code: 
	- Code formatting: remember to leave an empty line before an inline comment or a new code block. Now the code is very heavy to read without any whitespace. 
	- It would have been a good idea to include some ample data, like your input and output folders (a few travel time files and a grid) so that the user shouldn't have to download all the data. 
	- Currently, by default the GridFPFinder()  and some other functions are throwing an error since the files cannot be found. 
	- Excellent use of functions, assertations and errors throughout the work. Nice that you've built some helper functions inside more compilcated and longer functions. Some of the functionalities you've used were not covered during the course, so you've clearly put some extra time for learning Python. You have also followed good coding practices. Very good effort!

Pay a bit of attention to the readability of your code (and the whole repo) in the future! Overall, excellent work during the Python-course, congrats!
